# Simple Foraging and Random Aggregation Strategy for swarm robotics without communication. 

The following proposes a strategy using a Mealy Deterministic Finite State Machine (DFSM) that switches between five states with two different algorithms. The Rebound avoider/follower strategy through proximity sensors, and the search blob/ePuck approach using the 2D image processing of the ePuck embedded camera.
